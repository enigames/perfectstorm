* About Perfectstorm
  "Perfectstorm is a real time strategy game study written in common lisp
  using OpenGL for graphics display and cairo for texture generation. It
  is in active development with many of the basic features still
  unimplemented, but i decided the effort put into it justifies some
  public documentation." - Cupe
* Status
  As of now, it compiles and runs with sbcl and ccl (complete with bugs and
  all kinds of yummy things) but not clisp (yet).

  This doesn't mean it's even near completion though. As said, there
  are still bugs and crashes to take care of. There are also lots of
  features and things to be completed before we can get close to that
  end.
* Running it
  Add it to "path/to/quicklisp/local-projects/" so that you can load it
  into quicklisp with a simple:

  `(ql:quickload 'perfectstorm)´

  Then start the game with

  `(storm:storm)´

  Done, your running the game.
