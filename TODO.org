** Revive
*** DONE Make perfectstorm compile and run
*** DONE Update libs
    There is a lot of unportable bindings in use, so it's not just
    "change the loaded lib" and be done with it, we'll have to change
    the existing code to correspond to the new bindings.
*** TODO Fix/Change licenses
*** TODO Give Cupe more credit
** General
*** TODO GUI-System, plan out
*** TODO GUI Debugging: Unit-stats/target/command/etc
*** TODO Command groups to do more things except giving destination
*** TODO Shoot Rockets
*** TODO Air/ground weapons
*** TODO Sound
*** TODO Proper feature checking (especially for shaders) and nice error messages too
*** DONE Install cl-cairo2
*** TODO Heap and/or priority-queue package
** Bugs
*** Crash when the leader for the group dies
*** Mouse-cursor cannot be hidden, so one can't use the cool cursor instead
*** Crash when units run off the grid
** Graphics refactoring
   Requirements:
*** Draw on pieces that are sorted/grouped together
**** Composite things as standard feature, which rotate together, move, stretch?
     e.g. glows, caps at the end of laser
**** Children must also be reached over its name
*** Things in the engine have equivalent (entity) in the game
    think about it
