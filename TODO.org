** TODO first
*** Make perfectstorm compile and run
*** Update libs
    There is a lot of unportable bindings in use, so it's not just
    "change the loaded lib" and be done with it, we'll have to change
    the existing code to correspond to the new bindings.
*** Fix/Change licenses
*** Give Cupe more credit
** TODO for [[https://github.com/gpadd][gpadd]]
*** Read up on ENUMS for OpenGL
*** Translate the TODO in perfectstorm/doc
    into readable English and add it here.
