* TODO first
  + Make perfectstorm run
  + Update to cl-cairo2
    There is a lot of unportable bindings in use, so it's not just
    "change the loaded lib" and be done with it, we'll have to change
    the existing code to correspond to the new bindings.
  + Update cl-opengl and the rest also
  + Fix/Change licenses
  + Give Cupe more credit
