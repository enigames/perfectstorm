** Revive
*** DONE Make perfectstorm compile and run
*** DONE Update libs
    There is a lot of unportable bindings in use, so it's not just
    "change the loaded lib" and be done with it, we'll have to change
    the existing code to correspond to the new bindings.
*** TODO Change from cl-glut and co. to cl-sdl2..
*** TODO [#C] Fix/Change licenses
    Is this really important? Not really, at least not yet. Although
    it would be good to change to something like LGPL, BSD or MIT for
    the license.
*** TODO Give Cupe more credit
** General
*** TODO GUI-System, plan out
*** TODO GUI Debugging: Unit-stats/target/command/etc
*** TODO Command groups to do more things except giving destination
*** TODO Shoot Rockets
*** TODO Air/ground weapons
*** TODO Sound
*** TODO Proper feature checking (especially for shaders) and nice error messages too
*** DONE Install cl-cairo2
*** TODO Heap and/or priority-queue package
*** TODO Start doing things at the same time
    example: When having about 80 units on each team onscreen, and you select
    somewhere for a high % of those units to move, the game stops to
    calculate the path(s) there. Make it use a co-routine or something.
** Bugs
*** Crash when the leader for the group dies
    How is the leader determined? And (how) is it displayed to the player?
*** Mouse-cursor cannot be hidden, so one can't use the cool cursor instead
*** Crash when units run off the grid
    You will have to order them to do something though, otherwise it
    doesn't crash..
*** Crash when clicking outside the grid
** Graphics refactoring
   Requirements:
*** Draw on pieces that are sorted/grouped together
**** Composite things as standard feature, which rotate together, move, stretch?
     e.g. glows, caps at the end of laser
**** Children must also be reached over its name
*** Things in the engine have equivalent (entity) in the game
    think about it (it's brilliant)
