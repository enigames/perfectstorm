#+TITLE: The TODO
#+AUTHOR: See file: AUTHORS
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Revive
** TODO [#B] Create simple goals to work towards
*** TODO [#B] A goal for the game (How to finish a game)
*** TODO [#C] API for AI
*** TODO Create a configuration system
** DONE [#A] Make perfectstorm compile and run
** DONE [#B] Update libs
   There is a lot of unportable bindings in use, so it's not just
   "change the loaded lib" and be done with it, we'll have to change
   the existing code to correspond to the new bindings.
** DONE [#C] Fix/Change licenses
   Is this really important? Not really, at least not yet. Although
   it would be good to change to something like LGPL, BSD or MIT for
   the license.
* General
** TODO [#B] GUI-System, plan out
** TODO [#C] GUI Debugging: Unit-stats/target/command/etc
** TODO [#B] Command groups to do more things except giving destination
** TODO [#B] Shoot Rockets
** TODO [#C] Air/ground weapons
** TODO [#C] Sound
** TODO [#B] Proper feature checking (especially for shaders) and nice error messages too
** DONE [#A] Install cl-cairo2
** TODO [#B] Heap and/or priority-queue package
** TODO [#A] Start doing things at the same time
   example: When having about 80 units on each team onscreen, and you select
   somewhere for a high % of those units to move, the game stops to
   calculate the path(s) there. Make it use a co-routine or something.
* Bugs
** TODO Fix - Crash when the leader for the group dies
   How is the leader determined? And (how) is it displayed to the player?
** TODO Fix - Mouse-cursor cannot be hidden, so one can't use the cool cursor instead
** TODO Fix - Crash when units run off the grid
   You will have to order them to do something though, otherwise it
   doesn't crash..
** TODO Fix - Crash when clicking outside the grid
* Graphics refactoring
  Requirements:
** TODO Draw on pieces that are sorted/grouped together
*** TODO Composite things as standard feature, which rotate together, move, stretch?
    e.g. glows, caps at the end of laser
*** TODO Children must also be reached over its name
** TODO Things in the engine have equivalent (entity) in the game
   think about it (it's brilliant)
